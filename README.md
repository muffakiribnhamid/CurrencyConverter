This is my first React project, a simple and interactive currency converter. Built while learning the basics of React, this app allows users to convert amounts between selected currencies using real-time exchange rates. It includes custom hooks for fetching data, dynamic input handling, and a clean UI with Tailwind CSS.

I created this project to practice working with components, state management, and form handling in React. Iâ€™m excited to share it with the <b>Hack Club community<b/> as a step in my coding journey!
